The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to struggle against a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it trades near a nine-month low. During the Asian session on Monday, the JPY remains under pressure due to disappointing GDP data, which raises concerns regarding the Bank of Japan's potential delay in rate hikes. The current exchange rate reflects a broader weakness in the Yen, making it vulnerable to further declines.

As the USD gains momentum, the currency pair USD/JPY is witnessing increased trading activity, reflecting investor sentiment and economic outlook. The ongoing pressure on the JPY may lead to a reassessment of monetary policy, affecting not just the Yen but also influencing the broader forex market dynamics between major currencies like EUR and GBP. Traders are closely monitoring the situation for any signs of intervention or shifts in policy direction from the BoJ.
