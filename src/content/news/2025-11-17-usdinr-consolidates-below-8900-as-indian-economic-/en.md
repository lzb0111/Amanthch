The USD/INR currency pair continues its sideways consolidation, trading below the 89.00 exchange rate during the Asian session on Monday. This range-bound activity has persisted for approximately two weeks, as the Indian economic outlook helps to offset the strength of the US dollar. Market participants are closely monitoring these levels for potential breakouts.

The stability in the USD/INR pair indicates a balance between the dollar’s gains and the resilience of the Indian economy. Traders are assessing economic indicators and geopolitical factors, as fluctuations in this exchange rate could influence broader market sentiment. As the pair remains confined within this familiar range, future movements will likely hinge on upcoming economic data releases and developments in the global forex landscape.
