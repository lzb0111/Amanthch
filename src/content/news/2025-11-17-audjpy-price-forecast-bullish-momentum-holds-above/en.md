The AUD/JPY currency pair experienced a slight decline, trading near the 100.85 mark during the early European session on Monday. Despite this dip, the outlook remains bullish as the pair holds above the 100.50 level, close to the exponential moving average (EMA). This technical support suggests that any downside could be limited in the short term.

The stronger-than-expected Australian employment data has bolstered market sentiment, leading to heightened expectations for a cautious approach from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). This environment may encourage traders to maintain their positions in the AUD/JPY pair, with analysts closely monitoring how upcoming economic indicators may influence the exchange rate in the near future.
