EUR/USD is holding steady near the 1.1600 mark following the official conclusion of the US government shutdown. As of Thursday's Asian trading session, the currency pair is slightly oscillating around 1.1590, marking a pause after a six-day rally. This stability in the exchange rate comes amidst ongoing market reactions to recent economic developments.

The recent gains in the EUR/USD pair reflect broader market sentiment and investor confidence, particularly in light of the US government's return to normal operations. Traders are closely monitoring any further economic indicators that could influence the exchange rate, particularly as both the Eurozone and US face varying economic pressures. With momentum slowing, market participants are weighing potential shifts in monetary policy and their implications for the currency pair in the coming sessions.
