Gold (XAU/USD) remained steady on Wednesday, holding near a three-week high as traders adopted a cautious stance ahead of a pivotal US congressional vote aimed at ending the prolonged government shutdown. The precious metal is currently consolidating gains, reflecting investor uncertainty about the potential impact of the vote on market dynamics and the broader economy.

As the exchange rate for gold hovers around this key level, market participants are closely monitoring developments that could influence the USD's strength. If the government shutdown persists, it may lead to increased demand for safe-haven assets like gold, while any resolution could bolster the dollar and shift trading strategies among forex traders, particularly for pairs involving the EUR and USD.
