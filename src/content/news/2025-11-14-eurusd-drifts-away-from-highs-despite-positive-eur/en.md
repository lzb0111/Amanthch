The EUR/USD currency pair is experiencing a pullback after a robust seven-day rally, currently trading at 1.1615. Despite positive economic data from the Eurozone, the exchange rate has drifted away from its recent highs. The pair is still poised for a weekly gain of 0.45%, reflecting the overall strength of the euro against the USD.

Traders are closely monitoring market sentiment as the recent uptrend faces potential resistance. The positive Eurozone data initially supported the euro's advance, but profit-taking may be contributing to the current retreat. As the week concludes, the dynamics between the USD and EUR will be pivotal in determining future trading directions.
