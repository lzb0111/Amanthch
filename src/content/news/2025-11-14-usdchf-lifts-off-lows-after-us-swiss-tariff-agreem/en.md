USD/CHF experienced a modest rebound on Friday after hitting its lowest level since October 17 during the European session. The currency pair found support as traders responded positively to news of a new trade agreement between the United States and Switzerland. This development helped stabilize market sentiment, allowing the exchange rate to recover from its earlier decline.

The recent tariff agreement is seen as a crucial factor in easing trade tensions, potentially boosting economic relations between the two nations. As traders digest the implications of this deal, the USD/CHF exchange rate is likely to remain influenced by ongoing market sentiment and geopolitical developments, making it a key pair to watch in the coming sessions.
