The NZD/USD currency pair opened the week on a cautious note, trading within a narrow range of 0.5670 to 0.5675 during the Asian session. This movement comes as spot prices hover near a one-and-a-half-week high, which was reached around the 0.5700 mark on Friday, reflecting mixed market cues.

The USD is currently attracting safe-haven flows, contributing to the subdued performance of the New Zealand dollar. As traders weigh global economic conditions, fluctuations in the exchange rate of NZD/USD suggest a cautious sentiment, with market participants closely monitoring developments that could impact the pair's trajectory in the coming sessions.
