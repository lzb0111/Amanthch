The EUR/USD currency pair continued its downward trend, trading around 1.1610 during the Asian session on Monday. This marks the second consecutive day of losses, driven by a shift in market sentiment regarding Federal Reserve rate cut expectations. As traders reassess the likelihood of a more aggressive monetary policy from the Fed, the exchange rate has faced downward pressure.

The fading bets on rate cuts have strengthened the USD, contributing to the euro's decline against its American counterpart. Market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators and central bank signals, which could further influence the EUR/USD exchange rate. The movement of this currency pair reflects broader trends in the forex market, underscoring the delicate balance between monetary policy expectations and economic data.
