The Euro (EUR) is poised to revisit the 1.1655 level against the US Dollar (USD), as market movements suggest a consolidation phase for the currency pair. Analysts at UOB Group indicate that while a test of this level may occur, the next significant resistance at 1.1685 is unlikely to be challenged in the near term.

This outlook reflects a broader sentiment in the forex market, where traders are assessing economic indicators and geopolitical developments impacting the Eurozone and the United States. As the exchange rate remains stable, investors should monitor potential catalysts that could influence future trading dynamics for the EUR/USD pair.
