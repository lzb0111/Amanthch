The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the USD/CNY central exchange rate at 7.0816 for today's trading session, a slight improvement from Friday's fix of 7.0825. This move comes as the central bank aims to stabilize the yuan amid fluctuating market conditions, which have seen the currency pair trading under pressure.

Additionally, the reference rate is notably stronger than the Reuters estimate of 7.0956, suggesting that the PBOC is actively intervening to manage the currency's value. Traders will closely monitor this adjustment, as it could influence market sentiment regarding the yuan's future performance against the US dollar and other major currencies.
