Gold (XAU/USD) surged above $4,200 for the fifth consecutive day on Thursday, buoyed by a notable weakening of the US Dollar. The decline in the USD has heightened risk appetite among investors, especially following the resolution of the recent US government shutdown, which has contributed to renewed confidence in the market.

As the exchange rate of the USD falls, traders are increasingly turning to gold as a safe haven asset. This trend reflects broader market dynamics where risk sentiment plays a crucial role in influencing trading strategies. With XAU/USD now breaking technical resistance levels, further gains may be anticipated as the market adjusts to ongoing economic developments.
