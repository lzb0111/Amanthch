EUR/JPY continues its upward momentum, trading around 179.20 after reaching a multi-year high of 179.29 on Wednesday. This marks a 0.40% increase on the day, reflecting ongoing weakness in the Japanese Yen (JPY). The exchange rate's ascent highlights the ongoing divergence in monetary policy between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ), further fueling the bullish sentiment for this currency pair.

The persistent JPY weakness can be attributed to the BoJ's accommodative stance, which contrasts sharply with the tightening measures from the ECB amid rising inflation pressures in the Eurozone. As traders navigate these dynamics, the EUR/JPY pair remains a focal point, with market participants eyeing potential further gains if the JPY continues to underperform against the Euro (EUR). The current trading environment suggests that fluctuations in monetary policy sentiment will significantly influence this exchange rate in the near term.
