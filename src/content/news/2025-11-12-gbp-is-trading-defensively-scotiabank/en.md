The Pound Sterling (GBP) is experiencing a defensive trend, trading down 0.2% against the US Dollar (USD) as the market approaches the North American session. Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, highlight this softness in GBP, reflecting broader market sentiments and potential economic pressures.

As traders analyze the currency pair's exchange rate, the GBP's weakness may indicate underlying concerns about the UK economy amidst fluctuating global conditions. With ongoing focus on monetary policies and economic indicators, market participants will be watching closely for any developments that could impact GBP's performance against the USD and other major currencies.
