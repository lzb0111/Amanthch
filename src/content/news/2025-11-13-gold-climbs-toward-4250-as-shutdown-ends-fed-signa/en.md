Gold (XAU/USD) surged above the $4,200 mark on Thursday, marking a five-day winning streak as the market reacted to the recent resolution of the government shutdown. The precious metal now sits significantly above its recent corrective low, having recovered a substantial portion of its decline from the all-time peak around $4,381. 

This upward momentum has been bolstered by the Federal Reserve's cautious stance on interest rate cuts, which tempered easing bets and supported gold's appeal as a safe haven. As trading continues, investors are closely monitoring the interplay between gold prices and macroeconomic indicators, particularly the strength of the USD and evolving monetary policy signals.
