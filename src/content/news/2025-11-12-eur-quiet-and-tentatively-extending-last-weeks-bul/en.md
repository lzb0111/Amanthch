The Euro (EUR) is experiencing a period of calm trading in the mid to upper 1.15 range against the US Dollar (USD), as it cautiously builds on last week’s bullish reversal. This movement reflects a strengthening sentiment among traders, who appear to be optimistic about the Euro's potential for further gains.

As the exchange rate hovers around these levels, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators and geopolitical developments that could influence the EUR/USD currency pair. The recent uptrend may signal a shift in momentum, but traders remain vigilant, aware that significant resistance levels could test the Euro’s newfound strength in the near term.
