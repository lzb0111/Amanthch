The EUR/USD currency pair is currently trading in a narrow range below the mid-1.1600s, consolidating recent gains that have pushed it to over a two-week high. During the Asian session on Friday, the exchange rate showed stability as traders await a decisive move beyond the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which could signal further bullish momentum.

The weaker USD has provided support for the euro, allowing the EUR/USD pair to maintain its upward trajectory. Market participants are keenly watching for a breakout, as sustained trading above the 50-day SMA could strengthen the bullish outlook and attract additional buying interest in the coming sessions.
