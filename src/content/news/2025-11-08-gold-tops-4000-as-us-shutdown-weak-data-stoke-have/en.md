Gold prices surged during the North American trading session on Friday, climbing 0.64% as risk aversion heightened amid the ongoing US government shutdown. The XAU/USD pair was trading at $4,002, having rebounded from daily lows of $3,974. The uncertainty surrounding the government impasse and disappointing economic data have fueled haven demand for bullion, putting pressure on US equity markets ahead of the weekend.

As traders seek refuge in safe-haven assets, the implications for the broader market are significant. The persistent demand for gold reflects a shift in investor sentiment, with many anticipating continued volatility in the USD and broader economic indicators. With equities poised for weekly losses, the strengthening of gold highlights a growing preference for stability amidst market turbulence.
