The Pound Sterling (GBP) experienced a decline against the US Dollar (USD) during the North American session on Wednesday, with the GBP/USD exchange rate falling towards the critical level of 1.3100. This drop was primarily driven by rising political tensions surrounding Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as reports surfaced questioning his leadership ahead of the anticipated UK fiscal budget release.

Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as the uncertainty surrounding the UK’s political landscape may influence future trading decisions. A sustained move below the 1.3100 level could signal further weakness in the Pound, while any stabilization may depend on the fiscal measures unveiled in the upcoming budget. As the market assesses the implications, the focus remains on potential volatility in the GBP/USD currency pair in the coming sessions.
