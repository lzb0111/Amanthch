NZD/USD is trading higher at approximately 0.5680, reflecting a 0.60% increase on Friday. This rise is primarily attributed to a softer US Dollar as market participants adopt a cautious stance ahead of the upcoming US macroeconomic data releases, which have been postponed due to the recent government shutdown. 

Despite the gains in the NZD/USD exchange rate, the potential for a more substantial rebound of the Kiwi is limited by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's easing measures. The current market dynamics highlight the ongoing interplay between the currency pair's movements and the shifting macroeconomic landscape, creating a complex environment for traders.
