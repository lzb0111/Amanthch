The Indian Rupee (INR) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) at the start of trading on Friday, with the USD/INR pair dipping to around 88.85. This movement comes as the US Dollar continues its downward trend, influenced by a decline in the U.S. inflation data and shifting market sentiments.

Additionally, India’s Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation has decreased by 1.21%, signaling potential easing in price pressures. This drop in inflation could bolster the INR further as traders react to the developing economic landscape, impacting future currency exchange rates and trading strategies involving the USD and INR.
