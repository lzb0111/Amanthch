The GBP/JPY currency pair extended its gains on Thursday, rising modestly by 0.22%. As it trades at 203.82, the pair is approaching the significant 204.00 level while maintaining a healthy distance from the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 202.48, which serves as the first support level. 

However, the uptrend appears to be stalling amid renewed threats of intervention in the foreign exchange markets. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as any action could impact the exchange rate and affect broader market sentiment, potentially creating volatility for both GBP and JPY.
